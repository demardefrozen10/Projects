<ul>
  <li> Our project submission for Hack Western 9 (Nov. 2022) </li>
  <li> An academic planning tool for Western students which retrieves a list of all the courses necessary to complete a particular degree. </li>
  <li> Provides helpful information about each course, including a summary, required textbooks, prerequisites, and professors and their corresponding ratings (as seen on <a href="https://www.ratemyprofessors.com">ratemyprof.com</a>). </li>
  <li> The back-end was built with Python (Flask, Beautiful Soup, and Selenium), and the front-end was developed with vanilla HTML/CSS. </li>
</ul>
